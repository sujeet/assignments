Aim    : To implement big integers arithmatic in C++
====================================================
To compile : Use the command 

             'make'

             However, there is an alternate 
             possibility. You can use the command 

             'make bigint_ll'

             This gives a binary made with bigint
             implemented with long long int as 
             intenal storage type, which results in
             faster operations.

====================================================
Why two different internal storage types?

    The iso C++ standard doen't allow long long int
as a type. Hence for portability and standards' sake
the version which uses int as internal storage type
is the default one.

====================================================
The BigInt Class :

    The BigInt.h is header file containing useful
functions and methods of BigInt class. This is
written is such a way that it can be used in other
programs also (like a library).
    I have tried to make BigInt interface as
intuitive as possible. Following are some valid code
example which show the usage of BigInt class. For
all the available functions and definitions, read
the BigInt.h file.

|#include <iostream>                      |  
|#include "BigInt.h"                      | 
|                                         | 
|int main() {                             | 
|    BigInt a, b, c, d, e;                | 
|    a = -43876389473984397238703027;     | 
|    b = "84798378943874";                | 
|    c = a + b;                           | 
|    d = a++;                             | 
|    e = --b;                             | 
|    b = b - 3873;                        | 
|    cout << a << endl;                   | 
|    cout << boolalpha << (a < b) << endl;| 
|    cout << b << endl;                   | 
|    return 0;                            | 
|}                                        |

The output is like this

|-43876389473984397238703027             | 
|true                                    | 
|84798378940000                          |
